## Trello Description

Trello is a powerful project management app that allows you to organize tasks and projects with ease using a kanban board. Each board represents a project, with lists and cards serving as tasks and topics to be addressed. With Trello, users can modify boards, rearrange lists, and move cards around using a simple drag-and-drop interface.
Collaboration is made easy with Trello, as multiple users can work together in real-time, observing changes as they happen. The app also offers a wide range of other features, including the ability to add labels to tasks, set due dates, assign members, and more. Trello is an indispensable tool for teams of any size looking to streamline their project management processes.

## Application Features

- **_Boards_** - Create and manage projects with ease using a simple drag-and-drop interface. Users can create, remove, and update lists and tasks seamlessly.
- **_Tasks_** - Dive deeper into tasks with the ability to create, edit, and delete at every level. Features include labels, due dates, members, cover images, checklists, locations, attachments, activity log, comments, and the ability to move and delete tasks.
- **_Filtering_** - Efficiently filter tasks based on their title, members assigned, and labels.
- **_Side Menu_** - Customize the look and feel of the board by changing the background with the Unsplash Photo API. Stay on top of activity with a full board activity log.
- **_Google Login_** - In addition to regular authentication, users can log in using their Google accounts for added convenience and security.

We've put a great deal of effort into ensuring that our app stays true to the original Trello both in design and functionality. Our goal is to provide a seamless user experience that simplifies project management for teams of any size.

## Technologies

Our Trello clone was built using the following technologies:

MERN: We used MongoDB, Express, Vue, and Node.js to create a robust and scalable app that is both efficient and easy to maintain.

WebSockets: To enable real-time updates to the board, we implemented webSockets.

REST API: The app's front-end interacts with the back-end using the REST API method, which enables efficient and reliable communication.

Third-Party Libraries: We leveraged various third-party libraries to add features and functionality to the app, such as Google Login, D&D, Unsplash, and more.

Sass: The layout and design of the app were made with Sass, using functions, mixins, and variables to ensure pixel-perfect precision and consistency.

Our use of these technologies and libraries has resulted in a Trello clone that is both feature-rich and user-friendly, offering a seamless experience for project management.

## Getting started

Head to the repositories 'drello-frontend' and 'drello-backend' in my profile and clone the project or download the files.

```
git clone https://github.com/oxyhertz/Drello-front-render.git
```

```
git clone https://github.com/oxyhertz/Drello-back-render.git
```

Enter the backend part of the project and make sure you have node_modules installed. After that we will initiate the server with 'npm start':

```
npm i
npm start
```

You shuold get a console output that the server is up and running at port 3030.
Enter the frontend section of the project and repeat the same process.

```
npm i
npm start
```

You shuold get a console output that that the server is up and running at localhost:3000.

That's it! The App should open automatically, enjoy!

### Side menu

The right-hand menu, accessed by clicking the "Show menu" button, provides users with easy access to a range of features. One of these features is the ability to change the board's background using images from Unsplash. Additionally, the menu also allows users to view a full activity log for the board, providing valuable insights into project progress and task completion.

With the side menu, users can quickly and easily manage their projects and tasks, making it an essential part of the Trello clone project's functionality.

### Some mobile!

We're proud to offer a seamless mobile experience with our Trello clone project. Using various mixins and conditional rendering techniques, we've ensured that the app looks and functions great on all mobile devices.

Our development team used a ** "mobile first" ** approach to ensure that the app is optimized for smaller screens, with larger screens being considered secondarily. This design approach prioritizes the mobile experience and ensures that all users, regardless of the device they're using, have a positive experience with the app.
